    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had completed project stage one round up and started trying to work out the LEDs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Make one of the LEDs flash in a sequence.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, we made an LED flash.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We tried different connections to try when we couldn't make it work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned whether certain parts were broken.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I made sure I knew everything was in the right place by putting some in by myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We looked back at what we didn't understand last week and tried to improve on it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We made sure to work hard to catch up with our other classmates.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It would have been better if we were a bit more independent on the LED part. We did ask other pupils for help which is good, but we could have worked well by ourselves if we tried.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

    <td>Next time we will try to make multiple flashing lights work, because it didn't work this week.</td>
