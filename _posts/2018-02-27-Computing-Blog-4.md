    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>To have nearly finished a football badge across 9 DEFCHAR boxes.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To work through the booklet and finish stage 1 round up.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>No, I did not finish the whole of the round up of stage 1 but we did complete one of the tasks in the booklet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Well our group did quite well when we switched roles between working on the task on our fuze box and completing our blogs. This was quite effective because then not everybody was crowding around one computer and the people that weren't could do something useful with their time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes, we didn’t understand what we were actually typing but we just copied the code without understand. This meant that we didn’t actually learn and stopped our progress.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will work through the booklet efficiently and use all of the time in the lesson to help me complete as many tasks as possible. I hope to finish stage 1 round up.</td>
