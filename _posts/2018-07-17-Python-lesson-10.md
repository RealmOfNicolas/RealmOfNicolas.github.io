    <td>After finishing Python I was a little bit nervous to start HTML incase it was really hard and I was struggling a lot. However, I found this reasonably hard but it wasn't easy so it was good. I found the first lesson really fun as I learned to code my own website. What I did this lesson was I tried to not press the solution button at all and that worked and I managed to finish the course and even when I was stuck I kept going and kept trying. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that often the answer was right in front of me and I should’ve seen it and often I didn’t so I think that if I managed to read it properly and just went over it I would’ve been quicker and may have been able to start the next course quicker. Unfortunately this was the last lesson of the year.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>If I read the question more carefully and kept going and just read it then I would’ve been able to learn faster and be better.
Hopefully I will be better next week!</td>
