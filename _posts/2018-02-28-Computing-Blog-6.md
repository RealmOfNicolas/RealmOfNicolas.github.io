  <tr>
    <td>It would have been better if we were a bit more independent when we got to the LED part. When we got there were immediately asked Tom and Jasper, who were ahead of us, how we do it. We could have started by ourselves and tried to look through the booklet again, but instead we wasted theirs and our time in asking questions.</td>
