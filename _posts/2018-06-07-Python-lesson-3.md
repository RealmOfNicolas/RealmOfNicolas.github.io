    <td>We lined up outside and soon discovered we had a cover teacher unsurprising as our usual teacher was helping six formers.We logged onto the computers and got to work and just before the bell I had finished the lesson
</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I need to concentrate because if I was focused I would've finished long before the bell if I concentrated and hadn’t made silly mistakes and I would’ve been able to start a new lesson but I didn’t because of silly mistakes by me.</td>

    <td>I will concentrate and try to persevere more

Hopefully I will be better next week!</td>
