    <td>We entered the class for our first python lesson.We were assigned our 
Seats and I sat down. I was next to two people who were capable of mostly helping themselves.Our teacher told us what to do and then we were of and ready to learn. I logged on and signed up for Codecademyand made a new repository and forked Jekyll-now. Then our teacher called us in and explained to us about code academy and what made a good blog.
After that he told us to go work on code academy and get a feel for the lessons.

    <td>I think that whenever the person next to me was stuck I just did it for them and I think I should tell them what to do or tell them to figure it out
I think that I also need to listen more to the teacher whenever they speak</td>
