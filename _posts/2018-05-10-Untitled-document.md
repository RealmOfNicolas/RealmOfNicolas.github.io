    <td>To start the lesson we entered and straight away and started to do a lesson on codecademy. Then we got to start learning. I got started and was doing well and moving fast and I was half way through not to far into the lesson.However, the lesson got very hard and I was very confused.However, I did manage to finish the lesson.I think that the lesson went quite well and I was soon able to understand the question and got what I was doing in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that I should double check the question because when I was stuck I wasn't checking the question whereas if I had just read the question clearly it would’ve much easier. I think that if I had just taken a second to reconsider the question I could’ve finished it quicker and got onto the next lesson faster.
I think that when I was attempting the question I should understand the question and what it wants me to do so I understand python fully to make it easier in the future. </td>

Hopefully I will be better next week!</td>
