    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To try and complete project stage 1 round up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, I did not complete my target as I didn't even finish another exercise because our code kept on disappearing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>For some reason that even Mr Cullen didn't know, our code disappeared twice but we tried again to complete it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked Mr Cullen for help on my work when we got really stuck</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Our group tried to complete the task by ourselves until we really needed help.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I looked back and tried to see why our code didn’t work after it disappeared.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I tried hard to complete the task and I didn’t give up.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It would have been much better if we worked out why the code kept on disappearing. Also, I should have stayed more positive after we lost it the first time because I just got annoyed when we lost it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

    <td>Next time I will probably use one of school’s USB sticks because then I won’t have files from home that I can lose my school files in.</td>
