(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I think I did because me, Robin and Boaz worked as a group to experiment with colours of things and commands we could give it. We also helped other groups and managed to make a space invader, even though that was above our task.</td>

    <td>We learnt by asking questions to our fellow pupils and our cover teacher. We also learnt when we patient and valuing each others ideas when considering what to do next.
