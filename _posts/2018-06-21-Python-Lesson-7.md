    <td>I came in and I wanted to get to work straight away I then had to move place because someone else had been misbehaving so they had to go somewhere else. I then got to work I was just trying to do as much work as possible and I wanted to progress quite a bit further.I managed to do that and I got quite far in and I was doing well and I think that the progress that i made this lesson was very good and really improved my learning and I think that I learned a lot this lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that as it was getting harder with the lessons I was starting to skip the lesson more often and use the solution button. I think that this was really not helping because most of the time I was basically there I just needed to add something that I would have been able to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I will try and not just do the solution and I will try and just try it as I am actually very close to be correct and I will be able to just do it and work it again.

Hopefully I will be better next week!</td>
