    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Know how to program moving DEFCHARs and understand how a DEFCHAR works.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To make a football badge across 9 DEFCHAR boxes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I think I did because Robin and I worked quite efficiently to design and program the majority of the badge.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Boaz did not understand what a football badge was and even when we explained he was really not interested in it. Because the task was to design one, we decided to make the badge by ourselves. I designed the Barcelona FC badge and Robin did the maths calculations. I then programmed each square but we only got up to the first six in black and white. We learnt by splitting up the tasks.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One of the things that slowed me down was wasting time at the beginning trying to explain what a football badge was to Boaz. Although it wasn't really his fault, it did waste our time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will start working straight away so I use all of the time given. I will try and finish the black and white layer and then try and layer coloured parts on top of the original design.</td>
