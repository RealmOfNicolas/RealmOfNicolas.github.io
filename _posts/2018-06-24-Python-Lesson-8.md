    <td>I came into to the lesson and we found out we had a cover for that lesson.This was okay because our teacher only helps us with tips and codecademy did a lot of the teaching. I got to work straight away. However, I was with someone I usually talk with during lesson.I was able to work but I was slower but I was still able to do quite a bit of work doing 1 and a half exercises but I think that I should've been able to do more work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that if I had not been talking to the person next to me then I wouldâ€™ve been able to do a lot more work and I would be able to progress even further and would be able to learn more.Overall, I think this is the way that I will be able to improve and be able to learn more.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and not to talk to the person next to me about irrelevant stuff and then I will be much better than I was before, I will then be able to be better and if I do this then I will be able to learn much quicker and be able to do more complicated stuff.

Hopefully I will be better next week!</td>
