    <td>We came in and got to work straight away. We had been working for a couple of minutes when our teacher informed us that he wanted to have a look at our blogs so he came around and looked at them. He then explained the tasks for the day and our homework. After that I got to work on codecademy and I was working quite well but I was finding the exercise hard but I did manage to finish the codecademy lesson just on time as it was just before the bell.

  <tr>
    <td>I think that I need to persevere and slow down as I said before. Often when I was stuck I would just sit there or just get the solution and I think that I should just work through it.Then I would finish a lot earlier and would be able to do more work and then I would be able to do more work and I would be able to learn more and would be better in lessons.

  <tr>
    <td>I will try and slow down and persevere that way I will be better and I think that I really need to do this. I think that I would be a lot better if a was able to do more and then I would be faster.

Hopefully I will be better next week!</td>
