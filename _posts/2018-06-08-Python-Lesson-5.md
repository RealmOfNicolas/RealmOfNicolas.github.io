    <td>We came in and got to work straight away. I wanted to get to work straight away and so I did. I think that despite difficulties I tried extra hard and I managed to quite far and I got to lesson 4 and nearly got to lesson 5 as I was trying to work harder and faster. I think this paid off as I did manage to get further

  <tr>
    <td>I think that I need to slow down if I am finding something hard and I should take my time with it and not just go straight in if it is harder as that was often the reason to why I was stuck was because I hadn't read the instructions properly.However, from being a bit faster for some of them I was able to finish really easily and this was one of the main reasons I got further but I think that I need to slow down for the harder questions</td>
