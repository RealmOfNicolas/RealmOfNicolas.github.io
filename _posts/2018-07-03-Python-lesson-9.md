    <td>I came into the classroom and decided that I should try and be much better than I was last time and I think that I should get straight to work and that is what I did. I got to work, I found the first lesson quite easy and I did it quite quickly. Our teacher then asked us how far we had got in so far and I had 55%. After this I did more exercises and this was very hard. The next two I did were probably the two most hardest lessons I've ever done.Luckily I managed to complete both of them. We had quite a lot of homework this week.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that because it was so hard I was prone to just pressing solution when I was actually really close to the answer. If I had just changed something minor then I would of got it correct and I would’ve furthered my understanding. This would've made my understanding much better and I would’ve been able to learn quicker.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>If I had just preserved then I would be better at coding and then it would’ve made my homework much easier and I would’ve furthered my understanding of the subject.

Hopefully I will be better next week!</td>
