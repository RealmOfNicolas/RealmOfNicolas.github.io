  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Know how to connect a fuze box to a computer in the IT labs and know basic instructions on it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To continue working through the booklet and to have a go at creating moving images.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I think I did because me, Robin and Boaz worked well as a group to work through the book and we helped each other when creating the images because I typed the code, Boaz did the drawing and calculating, and Robin read through the book to check everything would work.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We learnt by working together on the tasks and helping each other. Another effective strategy was looking at other people's progress and seeing if our group could do that.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Although it helped my learning, I think I spent too long looking at my classmates work and what they had achieved instead of focusing on my own work. Also, I became quite slow at typing the code when being distracted at other things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will focus more on my work and less on my friends. We will also try and be more creative and challenge ourselves to make different things</td>
